### 2026-05-31 — General creative direction
The web audio theremin was a good start technically but needs to go much further conceptually. Think **Dada, Absurdism, Monty Python, Surrealism**. The ideas themselves should be weird and funny and unsettling — not just "cool web tech demo". Push the boundaries of creativity, not just the browser platform. The concept should be as surprising as the implementation.

### 2026-05-31 — The Anxiety Engine
**Concept:** A Dadaist bureaucratic dashboard from the "Department of Ambient Dread" that measures and amplifies your generalized anxiety, with a CALM DOWN button that makes everything worse.
**Technique:** CSS `@property` (registered custom properties) — declaring `syntax`, `inherits`, and `initial-value` so the browser can tween custom property values in transitions/animations (e.g., animating a `<angle>` hue value inside `hsl()`).

## Techniques & Skills Learned

#### CSS @property (Registered Custom Properties)
Declaring `@property --name { syntax: "<angle>"; inherits: false; initial-value: 0deg; }` tells the browser the type of a custom property, enabling smooth CSS transitions and animations through values that would otherwise just snap (e.g., hue angles in `hsl()`, raw numbers in `calc()`). Without registration, `transition: --my-var 1s` does nothing — with it, the browser interpolates correctly. Available in all modern browsers since ~2023.
